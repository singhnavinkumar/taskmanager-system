AI-Powered Task Management System

Overview

This AI-powered task management system is built using Golang with the Gin framework, providing efficient task management, real-time updates, and AI-generated task suggestions. The backend includes user authentication, task handling, WebSocket integration, and AI assistance for improved productivity.

Key Features

âœ… User Authentication â€“ Secure authentication using JWT tokens.
âœ… Task Management â€“ Create, assign, and retrieve tasks.
âœ… Real-Time Updates â€“ WebSocket integration for instant updates.
âœ… AI-Powered Task Suggestions â€“ Enhancing productivity with OpenAIâ€™s API.

Backend Implementation

1. Setting Up the Backend

The backend is developed using Golang with the Gin framework, known for its speed and efficiency in handling HTTP requests.

Technologies Used:

Gin â€“ A lightweight web framework for handling API requests.

JWT (JSON Web Token) â€“ Secure authentication.

Gorilla WebSocket â€“ Enables real-time communication.

2. User Authentication

Authentication is implemented using JWT tokens to ensure secure access.

User Signup: Users register with their credentials.

User Login: Upon login, the system generates a JWT token, which is included in subsequent requests for authentication.

Token Validation: The backend validates the token for every API request to ensure security.

3. Task Management

Users can:

Create Tasks â€“ Define tasks with a title, description, and due date.

Assign Tasks â€“ Assign tasks to specific users.

Retrieve Tasks â€“ View the list of tasks.

For simplicity, tasks are stored in memory, but a database like PostgreSQL or MongoDB can be integrated for persistent storage.

4. Real-Time Updates with WebSockets

To keep users updated instantly, WebSockets are used for:

New task creation notifications.

Task updates and completion status.

WebSockets maintain a persistent connection between the server and clients, ensuring real-time synchronization.

5. AI-Powered Task Suggestions

To enhance productivity, AI-generated task suggestions are integrated using OpenAIâ€™s API.

How It Works:

The user provides a task prompt (e.g., "Plan a marketing campaign").

The backend sends this prompt to OpenAIâ€™s API.

The API returns suggested subtasks (e.g., "Define target audience, Set budget, Choose ad platforms").

The user receives these AI-generated suggestions for easier task planning.

Deployment

The backend can be deployed on platforms like:

Render

Fly.io

Vercel

A database integration (PostgreSQL/MongoDB) can also be added for persistent storage.
